def update_game_state(game, user_input):
    # Logic to update game state based on user input
    # This includes moving the ball, detecting collisions, and updating scores
    # Example:
    if game.game_state == 'ongoing':
        # Update ball position based on velocity
        # Update paddle positions based on user input
        # Check for collisions and update game state accordingly
        pass
